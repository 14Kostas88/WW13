#### First, a list of valid constants and their purpose (MUST be enclosed in {brackets}): 

## (!!!todo) assuming you want a different form of capitalization for the value represented
## by your constant, you can do the following - assuming {SEASON} is a constant representing "Spring"
## - {SEASON} for "SPRING", {Season} for "Spring", {season} for "spring"
## For constants that don't need capitalization, you should should be able to use any format:
## TIMEOFDAY, timeofday, Timeofday, tImEofDAY, etc

# CLIENTS = number of clients online
# PLAYERS = number of mobs with clients attached
# MOBS = number of mobs online
# LIVING = number of /mob/living(s) online
# HUMANS = number of /mob/living/carbon/human(s) online

#### Some notes about the above constants:

## /mob/living/carbon is not here because it's being phased out
## observers and ghosts are excluded because they are not generally used here
## and also because there is no convenient list to efficiently get the number of them
## TODO: add observers and ghosts somehow

#### various game things

# TIMEOFDAY = displays the current time of day
# WEATHER = displays the current weather
# SEASON = displays the current season

#### meta game things

# ROUNDTIME = displays the current round time

#### other stuff

# null, Null, NULL, nil, Nil, NILL = nothing
